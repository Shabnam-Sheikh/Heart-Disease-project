#Heart Disease Data Analysis & Insight Generation

This project analyzes the Heart Disease UCI Dataset to explore patterns and risk factors associated with heart disease. Key focus areas include age, gender, cholesterol, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate. The data was cleaned and visualized using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. SQL was used for subgroup analysis and generating insights across demographic groups. The goal is to support data-driven healthcare decisions through meaningful insights.
